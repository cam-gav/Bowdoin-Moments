# Bowdoin-Moments

A geospatial storytelling platform for the Bowdoin community and alumni to capture meaningful moments at Bowdoin College. This story is a collective projectâ€”together, our moments map the layers of life at Bowdoin.

The interface is currently optimized for computer screens. You can access the site <a href="http://bowdoinmoments.pythonanywhere.com/">here</a>. If you are or have been part of the Bowdoin community, we encourage you to add a moment!

Please report any questions or issues to 10cpareja@gmail.com
